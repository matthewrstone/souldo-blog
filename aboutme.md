**Quick Bio**: A fine Christian lad, born and raised in Chicago. Does a lot of computer things. Met a girl. Got married. Had kids. Moved to Seattle. Did some DevOps stuff. Had more kids. Spent something like a month converting an easy hosted WordPress site that involved no maintenance into a statically generated website that sent him down the rabbit hole and now has an entire CI/CD infrastructure in his home. Does not understand the word "overkill".

**Talks**

- [Beyond the Registry: Puppet for Windows Administrators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TIJc78CKbU) : In which I bloviate for quite a while about tips and tricks for using Puppet to bend Windows to your will.

- [A Tale of Two Hierarchies: Group Policy and Puppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNW9pDZT-8c) : In which I propose that maybe in an increasingly domain agnostic universe you might want to learn how to pull things from group policy and use Puppet and hiera to get the job done.

Late last year I was asked if I had interest in making a video on the basics of Windows Server 2016 system administration for Packt Publishing. It has been a great experience and I'm happy to say that as of last week the first of two courses has been released!

**Getting Familiar with Windows Server 2016 Administration** take a pragmatic approach to performing basic system administration tasks on Windows Server 2016 and is geared for technially minded people that are new to Windows Server and want to take it out and kick the tires a bit. In it, I cover many of the core Windows Server features, like Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, Hyper-V, Windows Backup and more.

You can find more info and purchase it [here](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/getting-familiar-windows-server-2016-administration-video), or it is also available at many other fine video training sites. I hope you enjoy it!

Puppet released a "lite" version of the DSC module today ([release here]((https://puppet.com/blog/introducing-dsclite-new-dsc-module-puppet)). I've recently hit a wall where I needed to add a couple of DSC resources that weren't in the main module and figuring out the previous process was a bit beyond my time constraints so I'm looking forward to giving this a spin.

Also looking forward to not explaining to people why they check their puppet runs on Linux systems and see Exchange and Sharepoint popping up everywhere during the plugin sync. `You want pluginsync to benefit from a reduced footprint.` might be the understatement of the year. :)

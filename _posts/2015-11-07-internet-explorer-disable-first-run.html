<p>I’ve been dealing with building packages in Chocolatey quite a bit lately, and one of the things I’ve run into is trying to get ZIP files to play nice when they need to be retrieved from Invoke-WebRequest.  When provisioning systems from scratch I keep running into an error message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Invoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer’s first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, there is a fix for this.  In the registry, add the following key:</p>
<blockquote><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\DisableFirstRunCustomize</p></blockquote>
<p>Set the value to ‘2’, which will set Internet Explorer to go straight to the Welcome to Internet Explorer page instead of prompting you on first run.  While I initially used this as PowerShell inside an actual Chocolatey package, you could probably also use the Puppet registry resource and either stage it prior to package installation or require it before installing packages.</p>

Why blog after so long? Well, mostly as a use case for working on various automation tooling and to dig more into containers on Windows.

Short version, this blog moved from a hosted WordPress site to a statically built Jekyll site running in a Nano server container on AWS.

Long version, that was a bit of a journey and will be detailed throughout later posts.

Welcome back, blog.
